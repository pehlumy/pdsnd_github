### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The project explores data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
* Chicago
* New York City

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, we can access wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

This project use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

### Files used
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for three cities:

* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
